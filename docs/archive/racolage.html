While it’s necessary to wait in some lines, and good results can come of that, if you merely play by the rules and wait in lines you’ll get stagnancy, and that isn’t a very fun gift to open up for Christmas.<i class="doubleQuoteClose">”</i> <a href="http://www.musicthinktank.com/blog/11-reasons-why-your-music-self-promotion-isnt-working.html">[read more]</a>

However, if you have the ambition and the know-how, you can take your career to new heights with less effort than you think. For those of you with raw talent, your music just needs to be heard by as many people as possible, and the rest will be history.<i class="doubleQuoteClose">”</i> <a href="http://milehimusic.com/top-12-ways-to-promote-your-music/">[read more]</a>

          For this release by Spells Disaster, we experiment with a brand new technique : 
          mis-using the mentions system of academia.edu, a social network for academics. 
          We will try to upload generated papers to attrack clicks from other members from
          the site. Fingers crossed we will get a lot of plays through this ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
